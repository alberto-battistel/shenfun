*Summary.* This is a demonstration of how the Python module `shenfun <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun>`__ can be used to solve Poisson's
equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in one dimension. Spectral convergence, as
shown in Figure :ref:`fig:ct0`, is demonstrated.
The demo is implemented in
a single Python file `dirichlet_poisson1D.py <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun/blob/master/demo/dirichlet_poisson1D.py>`__, and
the numerical method is is described in more detail by J. Shen :cite:`shen1` and :cite:`shen95`.

   *Convergence of 1D Poisson solvers for both Legendre and Chebyshev modified basis function*

Model problem
=============
Poisson's equation
------------------

Poisson's equation is given as

.. math::
   :label: eq:poisson

        
        \nabla^2 u(x) = f(x) \quad \text{for }\, x \in [-1, 1], 
        

.. math::
   :label: _auto1

          
        u(-1)=a, u(1)=b, \notag
        
        

where :math:`u(x)` is the solution, :math:`f(x)` is a function and :math:`a, b` are two possibly
non-zero constants.

To solve Eq. :eq:`eq:poisson` with the Galerkin method we need smooth continuously
differentiable basis functions, :math:`v_k`, that satisfy the given boundary conditions.
And then we look for solutions like

.. math::
   :label: eq:u

        
        u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k v_k(x), 
        

where :math:`N` is the size of the discretized problem,
:math:`\hat{\mathbf{u}} = \{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}` are the unknown expansion
coefficients, and the basis is :math:`\text{span}\{v_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}`.

The basis functions can, for example,  be constructed from
`Chebyshev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials>`__, :math:`T_k(x)`, or
`Legendre <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials>`__, :math:`L_k(x)`, polynomials
and we use the common notation :math:`\phi_k(x)` to represent either one of them. It turns out that
it is easiest to use basis functions with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions

.. math::
   :label: _auto2

        
        v_k(x) = \phi_k(x) - \phi_{k+2}(x),
        
        

for :math:`k=0, 1, \ldots N-3`. This gives the basis
:math:`V^N_0 = \text{span}\{v_k(x)\}_{k=0}^{N-3}`.
We can then add two more linear basis functions (that belong to the kernel of Poisson's equation)

.. math::
   :label: _auto3

        
        v_{N-2} = \frac{1}{2}(\phi_0 - \phi_1), 
        
        

.. math::
   :label: _auto4

          
        v_{N-1} = \frac{1}{2}(\phi_0 + \phi_1).
        
        

which gives the inhomogeneous basis :math:`V^N = \text{span}\{v_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}`.
With the two linear basis functions it is easy to see that the last two degrees
of freedom, :math:`\hat{u}_{N-2}` and :math:`\hat{u}_{N-1}`, now are given as

.. math::
   :label: eq:dirichleta

        
        u(-1) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k v_k(-1) = \hat{u}_{N-2} = a,
         
        

.. math::
   :label: eq:dirichletb

          
        u(+1) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k v_k(+1) = \hat{u}_{N-1} = b,
        
        

and, as such, we only have to solve for :math:`\{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-3}`, just like
for a problem with homogeneous boundary conditions (for homogeneous boundary condition
we simply have :math:`\hat{u}_{N-2} = \hat{u}_{N-1} = 0`).
We now formulate a variational problem using the Galerkin method: Find :math:`u \in V^N` such that

.. math::
   :label: eq:varform

        
        \int_{-1}^1 \nabla^2 u \, v \, w\, dx = \int_{-1}^1 f \, v\, w\, dx \quad \forall v \, \in \, V^N_0. 
        

Note that since we only have :math:`N-3` unknowns we are only using the homogeneous test
functions from :math:`V^N_0`.

The weighted integrals, weighted by :math:`w(x)`, are called inner products, and a
common notation is

.. math::
   :label: _auto5

        
        \int_{-1}^1 u \, v \, w\, dx = \left( u, v\right)_w.
        
        

The integral can either be computed exactly, or with quadrature. The advantage
of the latter is that it is generally faster, and that non-linear terms may be
computed just as quickly as linear. For a linear problem, it does not make much
of a difference, if any at all. Approximating the integral with quadrature, we
obtain

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        \int_{-1}^1 u \, v \, w\, dx &\approx \left( u, v \right)_w^N, \\ 
        &\approx \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u(x_j) v(x_j) w(x_j),
        \end{align*}

where :math:`\{w(x_j)\}_{j=0}^{N-1}` are quadrature weights.
The quadrature points :math:`\{x_j\}_{j=0}^{N-1}`
are specific to the chosen basis, and even within basis there are two different
choices based on which quadrature rule is selected, either Gauss or Gauss-Lobatto.

Inserting for test and trialfunctions, we get the following bilinear form and
matrix :math:`A\in\mathbb{R}^{N-3\times N-3}` for the Laplacian (using the
summation convention in step 2)

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        \left( \nabla^2u, v \right)_w^N &= \left( \nabla^2\sum_{k=0}^{N-3}\hat{u}_k v_{k}, v_j \right)_w^N, \quad j=0,1,\ldots, N-3\\ 
            &= \left(\nabla^2 v_{k}, v_j \right)_w^N \hat{u}_k, \\ 
            &= a_{jk} \hat{u}_k.
        \end{align*}

Note that the sum in :math:`a_{jk} \hat{u}_{k}` runs over :math:`k=0, 1, \ldots, N-3` since
the second derivatives of :math:`v_{N-1}` and :math:`v_{N}` are zero.
The right hand side linear form and vector is computed as :math:`\tilde{f}_j = (f,
v_j)_w^N`, for :math:`j=0,1,\ldots, N-3`, where a tilde is used because this is not
a complete transform of the function :math:`f`, but only an inner product.

The linear system of equations to solve for the expansion coefficients
of :math:`u(x)` is given as

.. math::
   :label: _auto6

        
        A \hat{\mathbf{u}} = \tilde{\mathbf{f}}.
        
        

Now, when the expansion coefficients :math:`\hat{\mathbf{u}}` are found by
solving this linear system, they may be
transformed to real space :math:`u(x)` using :eq:`eq:u`, and here the contributions
from :math:`\hat{u}_{N-2}` and :math:`\hat{u}_{N-1}` must be accounted for. Note that the matrix
:math:`A` (different for Legendre or Chebyshev) has a very special structure that
allows for a solution to be found very efficiently in order of :math:`\mathcal{O}(N)`
operations, see :cite:`shen1` and :cite:`shen95`. These solvers are implemented in
shenfun for both bases.

Method of manufactured solutions
--------------------------------

In this demo we will use the method of manufactured
solutions to demonstrate spectral accuracy of the ``shenfun`` Dirichlet bases. To
this end we choose an analytical function that satisfies the given boundary
conditions:

.. math::
   :label: eq:u_e

        
        u_e(x) = \sin(k\pi x)(1-x^2) + a(1-x)/2 + b(1+x)/2, 
        

where :math:`k` is an integer and :math:`a` and :math:`b` are constants. Now, feeding :math:`u_e` through
the Laplace operator, we see that the last two linear terms disappear, whereas the
first term results in

.. math::
   :label: _auto7

        
         \nabla^2 u_e(x) = \frac{d^2 u_e}{dx^2},  
        
        

.. math::
   :label: eq:solution

          
                          = -4k \pi x \cos(k\pi x) - 2\sin(k\pi x) - k^2 \pi^2 (1 -
        x^2) \sin(k \pi x). 
        

Now, setting :math:`f_e(x) = \nabla^2 u_e(x)` and solving for :math:`\nabla^2 u(x) = f_e(x)`,
we can compare the numerical solution :math:`u(x)` with the analytical solution :math:`u_e(x)`
and compute error norms.

Implementation
==============

Preamble
--------

We will solve Poisson's equation using the `shenfun <https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun>`__ Python module. The first thing needed
is then to import some of this module's functionality
plus some other helper modules, like `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`__ and `Sympy <https://sympy.org>`__:

.. code-block:: python

    from shenfun import inner, div, grad, TestFunction, TrialFunction, Function, \ 
        project, Dx, Array, Basis
    import numpy as np
    from sympy import symbols, cos, sin, exp, lambdify

We use ``Sympy`` for the manufactured solution and ``Numpy`` for testing.

Manufactured solution
---------------------

The exact solution :math:`u_e(x)` and the right hand side :math:`f_e(x)` are created using
``Sympy`` as follows

.. code-block:: python

    a = -1
    b = 1
    k = 4
    x = symbols("x")
    ue = sin(k*np.pi*x)*(1-x**2) + a*(1 - x)/2. + b*(1 + x)/2.
    fe = ue.diff(x, 2)
    

These solutions are now valid for a continuous domain. The next step is thus to
discretize, using a discrete mesh :math:`\{x_j\}_{j=0}^{N-1}` and a finite number of
basis functions.

Note that it is not mandatory to use ``Sympy`` for the manufactured solution. Since the
solution is known :eq:`eq:solution`, we could just as well simply use ``Numpy``
to compute :math:`f_e` at :math:`\{x_j\}_{j=0}^{N-1}`. However, with ``Sympy`` it is much
easier to experiment and quickly change the solution.

Discretization
--------------

We create a basis with a given number of basis functions, and extract the computational
mesh from the basis itself

.. code-block:: python

    N = 32
    SD = Basis(N, 'Chebyshev', bc=(a, b))
    #SD = Basis(N, 'Legendre', bc=(a, b))
    X = SD.mesh(N)

Note that we can either choose a Legendre or a Chebyshev basis.

Variational formulation
-----------------------

The variational problem :eq:`eq:varform` can be assembled using ``shenfun``'s
:class:`.TrialFunction`, :class:`.TestFunction` and :func:`.inner` functions.

.. code-block:: python

    u = TrialFunction(SD)
    v = TestFunction(SD)
    # Assemble left hand side matrix
    A = inner(v, div(grad(u)))
    # Assemble right hand side
    fj = Array(SD, buffer=fe)
    f_hat = Function(SD)
    f_hat = inner(v, fj, output_array=f_hat)

Note that the ``sympy`` function ``fe`` can be used to initialize the :class:`.Array`
``fj``. We wrap this Numpy array in an :class:`.Array` class
(``fj = Array(SD, buffer=fe)``), because an Array
is required as input to the :func:`.inner` function.

Solve linear equations
----------------------

Finally, solve linear equation system and transform solution from spectral
:math:`\{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}` vector to the real space :math:`\{u(x_j)\}_{j=0}^{N-1}`
and then check how the solution corresponds with the exact solution :math:`u_e`.
To this end we compute the :math:`L_2`-errornorm using the ``shenfun`` function
:func:`.dx`

.. code-block:: python

    u_hat = A.solve(f_hat)
    uj = SD.backward(u_hat)
    ue = Array(SD, buffer=ue)
    
    print("Error=%2.16e" %(np.sqrt(dx((uj-ua)**2))))
    assert np.allclose(uj, ue)

Convergence test
----------------

A complete solver is given in Sec. :ref:`sec:complete`. This solver is created
such that it takes in two commandline arguments and prints out the
:math:`L_2`-errornorm of the solution in the end. We can use this to write a short
script that performs a convergence test. The solver is run like

.. code-block:: text

    >>> python dirichlet_poisson1D.py 32 legendre
    Error=1.8132185245826562e-10

for a discretization of size :math:`N=32` and for the Legendre basis. Alternatively,
change ``legendre`` to ``chebyshev`` for the Chebyshev basis.

We set up the solver to run for a list of :math:`N=[12, 16, \ldots, 48]`, and collect
the errornorms in arrays to be plotted. Such a script can be easily created
with the `subprocess <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html>`__ module

.. code-block:: python

    import subprocess
    
    N = range(12, 50, 4)
    error = {}
    for basis in ('legendre', 'chebyshev'):
        error[basis] = []
        for i in range(len(N)):
            output = subprocess.check_output("python dirichlet_poisson1D.py {} {}".format(N[i], basis), shell=True)
            exec(output) # Error is printed as "Error=%2.16e"%(np.linalg.norm(uj-ua))
            error[basis].append(Error)

The error can be plotted using `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__, and the generated figure is shown in the summary's Fig. :ref:`fig:ct0`. The spectral convergence is evident and we can see that after :math:`N=40` roundoff errors dominate as the errornorm trails off around :math:`10^{-14}`.

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
    for basis, col in zip(('legendre', 'chebyshev'), ('r', 'b')):
        plt.semilogy(N, error[basis], col, linewidth=2)
    plt.title('Convergence of Poisson solvers 1D')
    plt.xlabel('N')
    plt.ylabel('Error norm')
    plt.savefig('poisson1D_errornorm.png')
    plt.legend(('Legendre', 'Chebyshev'))
    plt.show()
